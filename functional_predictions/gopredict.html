  <h2>GO term prediction</h2>
  <p>To predict gene annotation with biological processes from the gene ontology (GO) we first calculate all pairwise gene correlations from the ARCHS4 RNA-seq expression. We then iterate over each of the 5192 biological process terms from the Enrichr gene set library. For each gene we calculate the average correlation of the genes in the gene set. The values are stored in a matrix Cij for i genes and j biological processes. We then z-score normalize all columns of C. Finally for each gene we sort the corresponding row of C ranking the terms on the gene population z-score. Terms with high z-scores are predicted to be accurate annotations for the gene. To show the correctness of the term ranking we calculate the area under the curve (AUC) from the ROC for all genes with annotations in GO. For GO biological processes the average AUC for retrieving already annotated terms is 0.765. </p>

<tr><td><a href="PKMYT1.html">PKMYT1</a><p> 
This gene encodes a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family. The encoded protein is a membrane-associated kinase that negatively regulates the G2/M transition of the cell cycle by phosphorylating and inactivating cyclin-dependent kinase 1. The activity of the encoded protein is regulated by polo-like kinase 1. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.
