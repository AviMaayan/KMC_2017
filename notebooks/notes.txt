GPCR
-----
GPR144 has a SNP which causes a missense mutation that is associated with aging. Zichen sent me this link

http://exac.broadinstitute.org/variant/9-127213445-G-A

I shuold try to incorporate this into our analysis if possible.

Ion Channel
-----------
I clustered the ICs based on CCLE gene expression. I identified five clusters from the dendrogram at level 4. These clusters were sent to Enrichr

* 1 https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/enrich?dataset=1botj
* 2 https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/enrich?dataset=1botl
* 3 https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/enrich?dataset=1botm
* 4 https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/enrich?dataset=1botn
* 5 https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/enrich?dataset=1boto

I looked for distinguishing information assocaited with these clusters of ICs and avoided obvious enrichment, e.g. they are enriched for Ion Channels. KEGG 2016, Wikipathways, and Reactome enrichment seems to give interesting and distinct results for the different clusters.
